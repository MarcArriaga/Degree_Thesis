# Head-pose determination using computer vision to determine the direction of the gaze

**Author:** Marc Arriaga Hidalgo

**Year:** 2020

This is the code used for my dregree's thesis at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya(UPC)

## Paths of the database

First of all the code in the file **create_txt.py** runs through the all the trajectories in the database to gather the path along with the yaw, pitch and roll angle of the head and the x, y positons of the person in the frame.

It saves a txt file for each trajectory, all the txt files are stored in the **paths** folder. 

The **split.py** file, stored in the paths folder, creates a txt file for the training and validation process and stores it in the **splits** folder.

## Analysis of the Results

The code that contains the analysis of the results is in the **Results.py** file, this code has the training and validation process of the Resnet50 model and it uses Tensorboard to generate comparisons for the predicted yaw and pitch angle and the ground thruth of these.

The code uses:
- Two Resnet50 Model to predict the Yaw and Pitch angles.
- Custom loss function
- Epochs: 160
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Optimizer: SGD
